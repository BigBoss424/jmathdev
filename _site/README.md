## Promise

I promise to use this template for educational purposes and not for profit. Though if there is, I would be very grateful. All information on this blog is free of charge and open to the public.

## Purpose

This is to be a publication of my notes from my
Math courses from here on out, from Calculus and beyond. I will be utilizing this blog to learn LaTex, and how to implement it online, so I can better express myself mathematically online. I want to sharpen my skills when it comes to Data Analysis and want to use this blog as a way I can test out if I can express my notes and thoughts, Algebraically, Graphically, Functionally, and Orally.

I will be focusing on learning Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MathJax, and other libraries that I will utilize to represent the graphs on this site.

## Pinnacle

I don't know how long it's going to take for me to reach a pinnacle on this site. The aspiration is to become more fluent in my mathematical skills, programming skills, and web development skills. By cementing my notes and exercises online and keeping a record of them, it will help not only me but those who utilize this site on their journey with Math.
